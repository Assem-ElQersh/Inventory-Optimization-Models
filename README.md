# Inventory Optimization Models

This repository provides a comprehensive Python library for inventory optimization and cost calculation using several models. It includes both classic and heuristic approaches, as well as a GUI for interactive analysis and visualization.


## Features
- **EOQ Model:** Economic Order Quantity for time-varying demand.
- **Wagner-Whitin Model:** Optimal lot-sizing using dynamic programming.
- **Silver-Meal Heuristic:** A cost-effective approach for lot-sizing.
- **Least Unit Cost Heuristic:** Minimize costs per unit over a planning horizon.
- **Lot-for-Lot Model:** Simplified approach matching order sizes to demand.
- **Part-Period Balancing:** Align order sizes to balance setup and carrying costs.
- **Three-Month Replenishment Model:** Fixed interval replenishment strategy.
- **EOQ Time Supply Model:** A time-based interpretation of EOQ.

The repository also features a **GUI** for easy interaction and plotting of inventory and cost metrics.
